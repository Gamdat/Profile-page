                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I've always loved coding, but it took me a while
                     to finally decide to start the journey. I began learning last year through AltSchool. It's been a mix of
                     ups and downs as i'm a beginner and didn't fully know what to expect.
                     The challenges were many, but thanks to my accountability partners and tutor who took their time to help me understand better. 
                     I'm here to test myself and my ability while learning from friends and colleagues.

        I hope you've gotten a hang of React, Vue.Js, and also a master of Tailwindcss, while still
